# Bear Tufting Website

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to create fully functional client-side webpage including communicating with servers using API and design framworks (Bootstrap and MUI).

_'JSON Server'_ is used to send user input from request form to our _'db.json'_.
Server can be started with the command `json-server --watch db.json
`

By default, React will run on `localhost:3010` and JSON server will run on `localhost:3000`.
